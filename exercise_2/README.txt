exercise2

Step-by-step instructions:

1) navigate to extweetcount directory
2) run with sparse run
	- while program runs, it count the volume in of each word from every  new tweet, storing it in a database
	- cntl+c to stop program
3) back out of extweetcount to exercise_2 directory
4) to see final results of counts for each word, use the command python
final.results.py command
	- running that command alone will return every word and its count, sorted by by count in descending order
	- running python finalresults.py <word> will return that word and its
	  count
5) for more targeted results, use python histogram.py k1 k2  command
	- k1 and k2 make the range of counts that for which words will be
	  displayed, inclusive
